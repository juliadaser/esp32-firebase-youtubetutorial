# 🌐 ESP32 Long-Distance Communication with Firebase

This project demonstrates how to send real-time data between two **ESP32 microcontrollers** using **Google Firebase** as a cloud-based bridge. It's designed for scenarios where devices are physically far apart but need to stay synced — ideal for **remote sensing**, **IoT communication**, and **wearable interaction**.

## 🎯 Overview

- Uses **Google Firebase Realtime Database** to sync data across devices.
- Connects two ESP32 boards: one with a button, the other with an LED.
- When a button is pressed on one board, an LED on the second board reacts — even over long distances.
- Built using **Arduino IDE**, with WiFi and Firebase libraries.
